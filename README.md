# 🧠 100 Days of ML – Image & Video Learning Journey

Welcome to my #100DaysOfML journey!  
Over the years, I've worked on low-latency video/audio streaming, image processing, backend systems, and Kubernetes infrastructure.  
Now, I'm diving deep into the world of **Machine Learning**, focusing on **images, videos, and real-time ML applications**.

This repository is a curated log of my learnings, code, notes, projects, and experiments. shared day by day.

(📌 I'll update this table every 5–10 days for easy tracking.)

## 🧭 Goals

- Build strong foundations in ML theory and PyTorch.
- Focus on **image & video-based models**: CNNs, transformers, detection, diffusion, huggingface, etc.
- Understand real-time ML deployment, fine-tuning models, and serving them in production.
- Build and open-source 3–5 practical ML projects involving image/video data.
- Bridge ML models with infrastructure for scalable deployment.
